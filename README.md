**Build muscle memory for programming constructs**

TreeType is a typing trainer that helps developers practice typing actual code syntax, not just words. Using tree-sitter parsing, it intelligently extracts the meaningful parts of code and creates a focused, distraction-free typing experience.

---

## What is TreeType?

Traditional typing games make you type random words or prose. TreeType makes you type **real code** with proper syntax highlighting, indentation, and structure.

As you type, the code progressively reveals itself through color—you're not just matching characters, you're **painting the code into existence**. It feels less like a test and more like creating something.

### What TreeType is NOT

- **Not a code editor** - It's a focused practice tool, not a replacement for your IDE
- **Not a comprehensive typing tutor** - It assumes you already know how to type; it builds speed and accuracy on code-specific patterns
- **Not a memorization tool** - You see the code you're typing; this is about muscle memory, not recall

---

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (for local file server)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TreeType.git
cd TreeType
```

2. Start a local web server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000/render_code.html
```

4. Select a language, choose a typing mode, and press any key to start!

### First Use

1. **Choose your language** - Start with Python if unsure (most readable)
2. **Select Standard mode** - It's the recommended balance of challenge and speed
3. **Click into the code area** - Or it will auto-focus when you press a key
4. **Start typing** - Only type the highlighted yellow character
5. **Press Esc anytime** - Reset and try again

---

## Typing Modes Explained

TreeType offers three preset modes that control what you actually type:

### Minimal Mode

**Type**: Keywords and identifiers only  
**Skip**: All brackets, operators, punctuation, quotes, string content, comments

**Use case**: Fastest typing, pure vocabulary focus. Great for warming up or learning new language syntax quickly.

**Example**:

```python
def calculate(n: int) -> list:
```

You type: `defcalculatenintlist`

---

### Standard Mode ⭐ (Recommended)

**Type**: Keywords, identifiers, operators, parentheses `()`, and essential punctuation (`:`, `.`, `,`)  
**Skip**: Curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, angle brackets `<>`, semicolons, quotes, string content, comments

**Use case**: Balanced practice with realistic code structure. You type the meaningful parts (including function calls) while reducing pinky strain from heavy bracket typing.

**Example**:

```javascript
setIsActive(!isActive);
```

You type: `setIsActive(!isActive)` (parentheses and operators typed, semicolon auto-reveals)

**Why this mode?**

- ✅ Practices function call patterns `()` (most common in programming)
- ✅ Includes operators and essential punctuation
- ✅ Reduces pinky strain (no Shift+bracket combinations)
- ✅ TSX/JSX friendly (angle brackets auto-reveal)

---

### Full Mode

**Type**: Everything except whitespace and comments/string content  
**Skip**: Only whitespace, comments, and string content

**Use case**: Maximum muscle memory building. Every bracket, every operator, every character. Closest to real coding.

**Example**:

```python
def calculate(n: int) -> list:
```

You type: `defcalculate(n:int)->list:`

---

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

TreeType uses a two-stage architecture:

1. **Parser (Python)** - Analyzes code using tree-sitter and exports structured JSON
2. **Renderer (JavaScript)** - Consumes JSON and creates the interactive typing experience

### Tree-Sitter Parsing

Tree-sitter is a parsing library that understands code syntax at a deep level. TreeType uses it to:

- Extract all tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.)
- Classify tokens into 9 categories for granular filtering
- Preserve exact positioning and indentation
- Handle multi-line constructs correctly (docstrings, template literals, JSX)

### Token Categorization

Every token in the parsed code gets assigned to one or more categories:

| Category           | Examples                           | Use                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `comment`          | `#`, `//`, `/* */`                 | Comments and docstrings  |
| `string_content`   | Text inside `"..."` or `` `...` `` | String literal content   |
| `string_delimiter` | `"`, `'`, `` ` ``                  | Quote characters         |
| `punctuation`      | `:`, `;`, `,`, `.`                 | Structural punctuation   |
| `parenthesis`      | `(`, `)`                           | Function calls, grouping |
| `curly_brace`      | `{`, `}`                           | Blocks, objects, JSX     |
| `square_bracket`   | `[`, `]`                           | Arrays, indexing         |
| `angle_bracket`    | `<`, `>`, `</`, `/>`               | JSX/TSX tags             |
| `operator`         | `=`, `+`, `->`, `=>`               | Operators                |

These categories power the preset filtering system. Each mode excludes different categories to create the desired typing experience.

### Progressive Reveal System

The magic of TreeType is how code "appears" as you type:

1. **Gray text** = Not yet typed (neutral canvas)
2. **Yellow highlight** = Current character to type
3. **Syntax colors** = Already typed (code revealed)
4. **Red highlight** = Error (stays until corrected)

Non-typeable tokens (like curly braces in Standard mode) automatically transition from gray → colored as your cursor passes them, creating a smooth "painting" effect.

### Client-Side Filtering

When you switch typing modes, TreeType doesn't reload the file—it regenerates the typing sequence on the fly:

1. Filter `display_tokens` based on preset's exclusion rules
2. Rebuild `typing_sequence` from remaining typeable tokens
3. Regenerate `char_map` (character index → display position mapping)
4. Reset test and re-render

This happens instantly and allows mid-test preset switching.

### Parser Architecture (`parse_json.py`)

**Key functions**:

- `categorize_token()` - Assigns category labels to tokens (9 categories including split brackets)
- `is_non_typeable()` - Marks structural whitespace as non-typeable
- `parse_code_to_dataframe()` - Tree-sitter → Pandas DataFrame
- `dataframe_to_json()` - DataFrame → Frontend-ready JSON

**JSON output structure**:

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "total_lines": 10,
  "lines": [
    {
      "line_number": 0,
      "indent_level": 0,
      "actual_line": "def calculate(n: int):",
      "display_tokens": [
        {
          "text": "def",
          "type": "keyword",
          "categories": [],
          "base_typeable": true,
          "start_col": 0,
          "end_col": 3
        },
        {
          "text": "(",
          "type": "(",
          "categories": ["parenthesis"],
          "base_typeable": true,
          "start_col": 13,
          "end_col": 14
        }
      ],
      "typing_sequence": "defcalculatenint",
      "char_map": {
        "0": { "token_idx": 0, "display_col": 0 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Implementation (`render_code.html`)

**Core functions**:

- `applyExclusionConfig()` - Client-side filtering based on preset
- `renderLineTokens()` - Applies progressive reveal states to each character
- `handleKeyPress()` - Validates input, manages error persistence
- `moveToNextLine()` - Advances to next typeable line, triggers scroll
- `manualSmartScroll()` - Ergonomic centering with down-only constraint
- `completeTest()` - Calculates metrics, displays modal

**State management**:

```javascript
testState = {
  active: false, // Is test running?
  startTime: null, // Timestamp of first keystroke
  currentLineIndex: 0, // Which line is active
  currentCharIndex: 0, // Position in typing_sequence
  totalCharsTyped: 0, // Correct chars (for WPM)
  totalErrors: 0, // Wrong keystrokes
  completedLines: Set, // Lines fully typed
  errorOnCurrentChar: false, // Is current char in error state?
};
```

**Preset filtering logic**:

Each preset defines:

- `exclude` - Array of categories to skip
- `includeSpecific` - Array of specific characters to include (overrides category exclusion)

Example (Standard mode):

```javascript
{
  exclude: [
    "curly_brace",
    "square_bracket",
    "angle_bracket",
    "punctuation",
    "string_content",
    "string_delimiter",
    "comment"
  ],
  includeSpecific: [":", ".", ",", "(", ")"]  // Essential punctuation + parentheses
}
```

### Configuration Persistence

User preferences are saved to `localStorage`:

```javascript
{
  "preset": "standard",    // Last selected typing mode
  "language": "python"     // Last selected language
}
```

Loaded on page load, saved on every change.

## Development Philosophy

TreeType was built using a phased, validation-driven approach:

### Principles

1. **Baseline first** - Prove each layer works before adding complexity
2. **Incremental validation** - Each phase has clear success criteria
3. **Low-risk assumptions** - Test what we think we know
4. **Rollback-friendly** - Each phase is independently functional
5. **UX-driven iteration** - Respond to user feedback and discoveries

### Why This Matters

Traditional typing games feel mechanical—you're matching characters, not creating. TreeType's progressive reveal system transforms typing from validation into creation. Every keystroke reveals structure and meaning.

This UX breakthrough emerged from testing, not planning. Phase 3's "auto-jump" experiment failed, leading to the insight that non-typeable elements should auto-reveal rather than require explicit skipping. That insight became the core of the experience.

**Good software emerges from iteration, not specification.**

---

## Roadmap

### ✅ Completed Phases

- **Phase 1** - Static rendering (tree-sitter parsing, syntax highlighting)
- **Phase 2** - Typing sequence logic (cursor tracking, character validation)

## Questions?

### Why not use existing typing trainers?

Traditional typing trainers focus on prose or random words. Code has unique patterns:

- Frequent use of brackets, operators, punctuation
- Significant indentation and structure
- Language-specific syntax
- Less common character combinations

TreeType is purpose-built for these patterns.

### Why only 4 languages?

Tree-sitter supports 40+ languages, but these 4 cover the most common web/data development scenarios. Adding languages is straightforward—each requires a parser import and sample file. Phase 6 will let users upload their own code in any supported language.

### Can I use this offline?

Yes! Once you've cloned the repo and generated the JSON samples, everything runs locally. No internet required after initial setup.

### Why is the full app in a single HTML file?

Simplicity. For a project this size, bundling tools add complexity without benefit. Everything is readable and hackable in one place. May split into modules in Phase 7 if complexity demands it.

### What's the WPM calculation?

Standard typing metric: (characters typed / 5) / (time in minutes). The "5" is the industry standard for average word length. So 300 characters in 1 minute = 60 WPM.
